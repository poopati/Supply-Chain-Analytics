# **Problem Statement :**  

**AtliQ Mart** is a growing **FMCG manufacturer** headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ‚ÄôOn time‚Äô and ‚ÄòIn Full‚Äô delivery service level for all the customers daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure **‚ÄòOn-time delivery (OT) %‚Äô, ‚ÄòIn-full delivery (IF) %‚Äô, and OnTime in full (OTIF) %‚Äô** of the customer orders daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.


# **üåü Solution :**  

To address AtliQ Mart's service issues and enhance customer satisfaction, I have developed a dashboard to monitor delivery performance and identify problem areas effectively.

**Key Features**  

- **Order Tracking :**  Track orders by customer, city, and product to gain insights into order trends.
- **Service Level Metrics :**  Monitor **On-Time Delivery (OT%)**, **In-Full Delivery (IF%)**, and **On-Time In-Full (OTIF%)** against customer-specific targets.
- **City-Wise Performance :**  Compare OT%, IF%, and OTIF% across Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara to identify city-specific challenges.  
- **Customer Insights :**  Identify customers with below-target service levels to prioritize corrective actions.  
- **Product Performance :**  Analyze **Line Fill Rate (LFR)** and **Volume Fill Rate (VFR)** for products and categories to assess delivery efficiency.  
- **Delay Analysis :**  Visualize delivery delays by month, customer, city, and product to uncover root causes.  

This dashboard empowers AtliQ Mart to proactively resolve service issues, improve customer retention, and prepare for expansion into new markets.
